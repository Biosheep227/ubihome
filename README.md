The goal of smart home agents is to understand human behaviors in natural home environments using non-intrusive sensing. However, existing methods rely on explicit interactions like voice commands, which may disrupt natural behaviors, or well-labeled datasets trained with expert models. In this paper, we introduce UbiLLM Home, a platform that explores integrating large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal ubiquitous sensing techniques to achieve ubiquitous LLMs and create personalized automation routines in smart homes.
